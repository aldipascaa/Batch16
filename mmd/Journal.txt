Classes

Fields: variable that store the state of an object

"Instance Fields
Characteristics:
-Each object instance maintains its own copy
-values can differ between different object
-Modified independently for each object
-Accessed through object instances 

Ex:
// Each Employee object has its own name and salary
Employee emp1 = new Employee { Name = "John", Salary = 50000 };
Employee emp2 = new Employee { Name = "Sarah", Salary = 60000 };
// emp1.Name and emp2.Name are completely independent


"Static Fields
Characteristics:
-Shared accross all instance of the class
-exists even before any objects are created
-modified through the class name not instance
-useful for counters, shared configuration of class level data

"readonly Fields
Characteristic:
-Can be assigned only at declaration or in constructors
-cannot be modified after object construction
-profides compile time safety for immutable data
-can be instance specific or static

Properties: Constrolled Access to Object Data
Characteristics:
-Compiler generates hidden backing fields automatically
-reduces boilerplate code for simple get/set operations
-maintains encapsulation without extra complexity
-can include access modifiers

properties with backing fields
-full control over get and set operations
-enable
